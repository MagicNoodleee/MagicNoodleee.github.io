Quantum technology has led to increasingly sophisticated and complex quantum devices. Assessing
their reliability (quantum reliability) is an important issue. Although reliability theory for classical devices
has been well developed in industry and technology, a suitable metric on quantum reliability and its loss has
not been systematically investigated. Since reliability loss depends on the process, quantum fidelity does
not always fully depict it. This study provides a metric of quantum reliability by shifting the focus from
state distinguishing to trajectory distinguishing. In contrast to the conventional notion of classical
reliability, which is evaluated using probabilistic measurements of binary logical variables, quantum
reliability is grounded in the quantum probability amplitude or wave function. This research provides a
universal framework for reliability theory encompassing both classical and quantum devices. It offers a new
perspective on quantum engineering by elucidating how intensely the real quantum process that a device
undergoes influences its performance.
